I am a very big fan of fishing, football and hockey, and enjoy editing and designing videos in my spare time. I am receiving a bachelors degree from UCF in Health Sciences Pre-Clinical. My favorite class that I have ever taken has been Organic Chemistry 2, and I also have a love for Anatomy. I am currently taking an online bootcamp in Software Development from the University of Central Florida. Feel free to reach out using the contact page! </p>
